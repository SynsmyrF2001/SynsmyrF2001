## 🏆 Featured Projects 

### 🌦️ **Weather App w/ Swift 🦅** | 

#### 🔹 Overview:  

→ This app provides real-time weather updates, offering a clean and simple interface for users to check current weather conditions at their location or any city around the world.

#### 🔹 Why It Matters: 

As my **first ever project in Swift**, the Tether Weather App allowed me to:

✔ Get hands-on experience with **iOS app development**.

✔ Understand how to integrate **third-party APIs** and parse JSON data.

✔ Practice working with **SwiftUI/UIKit**, **network requests**, and **asynchronous operations**.

✔ Learn how to design and structure an app for **scalability and maintainability**.

### 🧠 **MERN Thinkboard - Full-Stack Note-Taking App** | [Live Demo](https://mern-stack-thinkboard-57eb.onrender.com/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/SynsmyrF2001/mern-stack-thinkboard)

#### 🔹 Overview:    

→ A modern, responsive note-taking application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) featuring real-time rate limiting, beautiful UI, and full CRUD operations.

#### ✨ Features:  

✔ **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete notes seamlessly

✔ **Modern UI/UX**: Beautiful, responsive design with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI

✔ **Real-time Updates**: Instant UI updates when notes are modified

#### 🔹 Why It Stands Out:  
✔ **Full-Stack Mastery**: Demonstrates proficiency in both frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express) development

✔ **Database Integration**: MongoDB with Mongoose for data persistence and management

✔ **API Security**: Implements rate limiting and CORS for production-ready security

✔ **Modern Tech Stack**: Uses cutting-edge technologies like React 19, Vite, and Tailwind CSS

✔ **Deployment Ready**: Successfully deployed and accessible online with proper error handling
