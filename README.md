## 👨🏾‍💻 Hi there, I'm Synsmyr! 🙋🏾‍♂️

I'm a Computer Science major with a strong passion for problem-solving and all things STEM. Ever since I stepped into the STEM world, I've never looked back. I'm in love with the process—whether it's writing clean code, analyzing data, or collaborating with a team, I believe that discipline and persistence are the keys to great results.

With a strong foundation in software development, data analysis, and customer support, I'm driven to build impactful, scalable solutions that make a difference. I thrive in fast-paced, team-oriented environments where learning never stops. I'm currently seeking opportunities in Software Engineering, Data Science, or IT Engineering where I can apply my skills, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue growing professionally.

## 🏆 Featured Projects 

### 🌦️ **Weather App w/ Swift 🦅** | 

#### 🔹 Overview:  

→ This app provides real-time weather updates, offering a clean and simple interface for users to check current weather conditions at their location or any city around the world.

#### 🔹 Why It Matters: 

As my **first ever project in Swift**, the Tether Weather App allowed me to:

✔ Get hands-on experience with **iOS app development**.

✔ Understand how to integrate **third-party APIs** and parse JSON data.

✔ Practice working with **SwiftUI/UIKit**, **network requests**, and **asynchronous operations**.

✔ Learn how to design and structure an app for **scalability and maintainability**.

### 🧠 **MERN Thinkboard - Full-Stack Note-Taking App** | [Live Demo](https://mern-stack-thinkboard-57eb.onrender.com/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/SynsmyrF2001/mern-stack-thinkboard)

#### 🔹 Overview:    

→ A modern, responsive note-taking application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) featuring real-time rate limiting, beautiful UI, and full CRUD operations.

#### ✨ Features:  

✔ **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete notes seamlessly
✔ **Modern UI/UX**: Beautiful, responsive design with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
✔ **Real-time Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against API abuse using Upstash Redis
✔ **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
✔ **Production Ready**: Optimized for deployment with proper error handling
✔ **Real-time Updates**: Instant UI updates when notes are modified

#### 🔹 Why It Stands Out:  
✔ **Full-Stack Mastery**: Demonstrates proficiency in both frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express) development

✔ **Database Integration**: MongoDB with Mongoose for data persistence and management

✔ **API Security**: Implements rate limiting and CORS for production-ready security

✔ **Modern Tech Stack**: Uses cutting-edge technologies like React 19, Vite, and Tailwind CSS

✔ **Deployment Ready**: Successfully deployed and accessible online with proper error handling
