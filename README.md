## 👨🏾‍💻 Hi there, I'm Synsmyr! 🙋🏾‍♂️

I’m a Computer Science major with a strong passion for problem-solving and all things STEM. Ever since I stepped into the STEM world, I’ve never looked back. I’m in love with the process—whether it’s writing clean code, analyzing data, or collaborating with a team, I believe that discipline and persistence are the keys to great results.

With a strong foundation in software development, data analysis, and customer support, I’m driven to build impactful, scalable solutions that make a difference. I thrive in fast-paced, team-oriented environments where learning never stops. I’m currently seeking opportunities in Software Engineering, Data Science, or IT Engineering where I can apply my skills, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue growing professionally.
